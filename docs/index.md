## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "instana" {
  api_token = "secure-api-token"  
  endpoint = "<tenant>-<org>.instana.io"
  default_name_prefix = ""
  default_name_suffix = "(TF managed)"
  tls_skip_verify     = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `api_token` - Required - The API token which is created in the Settings area of Instana for remote access through 
the REST API. You have to make sure that you assign the proper permissions for this token to configure the desired 
resources with this provider. E.g. when User Roles should be provisioned by terraform using this provider implementation 
then the permission 'Access role configuration' must be activated. (Defaults to the environment variable `INSTANA_API_TOKEN`).
* `endpoint` - Required - The endpoint of the instana backend. For SaaS the endpoint URL has the pattern
`<tenant>-<organization>.instana.io`. For onPremise installation the endpoint URL depends on your local setup. (Defaults to the environment variable `INSTANA_ENDPOINT`).
* `default_name_prefix` - Optional - string will be added in front the resource UI name or label by default
(not supported by all resources). For existing resources the string will only be added when the name/label is changed.
**Deprecated:** "This feature will be removed in version 2.x and should be replaced with the native format function"
* `default_name_suffix` - `Optional` - Default value " (TF managed)" - string will be appended to the resource UI name or 
label by default (not supported by all resources). For existing resources the string will only be appended when the 
name/label is changed.
**Deprecated:** "This feature will be removed in version 2.x and should be replaced with the native format function"
* `tls_skip_verify` - `Ã’ptional` - Default `false` - If set to true, TLS verification will be skipped when calling Instana API

## Import support

All resources of the terraform provider instana support resource import. 

*Note:* During import the `default prefix` and `suffix` will be removed from the `name` when
available. If the `name` as received from the Instana API does not contain the `default
prefix` and `suffix` the name will be stored as is. The `default prefix` and `suffix` will not
be appended automatically. In this case `default prefix` and `suffix` will be appended with the
first change of the name attribute in the resource definition.
